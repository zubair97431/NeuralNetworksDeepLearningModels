# NeuralNetworksDeepLearningModels

## In this challenge, I had to build my own machine learning model that would be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. My trained model would be used to determine the future decisions of the company, only those projects likely to be a success would receive any future funding from Alphabet Soup.
